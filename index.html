            <h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>

            <div>

                <p>"I want you to beware of him."</p>

                <p>"To see him is to worship him; to know him is to trust him."</p>

                <p>"Sibyl, you are mad about him."</p>

                <p>She laughed and took his arm. "You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself. 
                Then you will know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Surely you should be glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me 
                happier than I have ever been before. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and difficult. But it will be different now. You 
                are going to a new world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by."</p>

                <p>They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire. A white 
                dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air. The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like 
                monstrous butterflies.</p>

                <p>She made her brother talk of himself, his hopes, his prospects. He spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other 
                as players at a game pass counters. Sibyl felt oppressed. She could not communicate her joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth 
                was all the echo she could win. After some time she became silent. Suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, 
                and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.</p>

                <p>She started to her feet. "There he is!" she cried.</p>

                <p>"Who?" said Jim Vane.</p>

                <p>"Prince Charming," she answered, looking after the victoria.</p>

                <p>He jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm. "Show him to me. Which is he? Point him out. I must see him!" he exclaimed; but 
                at that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of 
                the park.</p>

                <p>"He is gone," murmured Sibyl sadly. "I wish you had seen him."</p>

                <p>"I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him."</p>

                <p>She looked at him in horror. He repeated his words. They cut the air like a dagger. The people round began to gape. A lady 
                standing close to her tittered.</p>

                <p>"Come away, Jim; come away," she whispered. He followed her doggedly as she passed through the crowd. He felt glad at what 
                he had said.</p>

                <p>When they reached the Achilles Statue, she turned round. There was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips. She 
                shook her head at him. "You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible 
                things? You don't know what you are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you would fall in love. Love 
                makes people good, and what you said was wicked."</p>
